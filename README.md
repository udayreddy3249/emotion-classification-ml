# Emotion Classification from Text using Machine Learning
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify emotions expressed in textual data. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model can predict emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and more from user-generated text.
## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
## 📌 Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Emotion classification using machine learning models
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
## 📈 Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 89% on the validation set.
